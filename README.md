# Android Counter mobile application

This was my first Android application made in Android Studio. This was so I could show what I have learned in Kotlin and apply it into Android Studio.


This is a simple program where the number 0 is displayed on the screen with 3 different buttons. An add button, subtract, and reset.
When add is pressed, the number is changed to 1. When subtract is pressed, the number is subracted by 1 to zero. Reset changes the number to zero.
This app can be used to keep track of anything, amount of cookies eaten in one sitting (sometimes that number shocks me), amount of people in an atteneded event, 
or anything that is needed to be kept track of.
